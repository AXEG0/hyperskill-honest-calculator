Honest Calculator is an application that motivates users rely on their own mind rather than computer calculations

Example:
Enter an equation
> 2 + 3
You are ... lazy
> 5.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
> y
Are you sure? It is only one digit! (y / n)
> y
Don't be silly, it's just one number! Add to the memory? (y / n)
> n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
> y
Enter an equation
> 5 + M
You are ... lazy ... very, very lazy
> 5.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
> y
Are you sure? It is only one digit! (y / n)
> y
Don't be silly, it's just one number! Add to memory? (y / n)
> y
Last chance! Do you really want to embarrass yourself? (y / n)
> y
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
> y
Enter an equation
> M / M
You are ... lazy
> 1.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
> n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
> n
